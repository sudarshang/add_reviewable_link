## Usage

First get the code and build it:

```
# get code
git clone https://github.com/sudarshang/add_reviewable_link.git

# get deps and build
cd add_reviewable_link
npm install
# ensure you're running latest version!
npm update
npm run build
```

Now ensure the code loads and works:

- Load the folder containing the extension (or `manifest.json`) in
  your browser.
- Load `mail.google.com` in your browser
- Open an email accessing you to review some code
- Profit!

Cheers!
